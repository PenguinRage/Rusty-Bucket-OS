# About the project
This is a hobby project I have decided to look in to. The purpose of the project was to help me learn Rust and give me a better understanding into Linux Kernals, GRUB2, dealing with other interesting problems involved with such builds.

# Running the project
As recommended from Philipp Oppermann's blog, I will be using QEMU. To run the iso file built from the project.
